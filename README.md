# PaymentDemo
 This is a code challenge.

How To:
1) Run this project in Docker:
Go to Docker and run "Run.ps1" with PowerShell.

2) Run this project in Visual Studio:
Clone this Repo. Run it using PaymentDemo profile (instead of IIS Express).


The only endpoint is located at: http://localhost:5000/api/payments (use a POST verb)
Or even better, try out it's basic Swagger documentation: http://localhost:5000/swagger

The app will automatically create and seed it's database.
